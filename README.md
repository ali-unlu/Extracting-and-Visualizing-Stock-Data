# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

In this demonstration, I will show you how to exract stock data and revenue to show their variation during time. 

### Basically, this analysis includes:

1. Extracting Tesla Stock Data Using yfinance 
2. Extracting Tesla Revenue Data Using Webscraping 
3. Extracting GameStop Stock Data Using yfinance 
4. Extracting GameStop Revenue Data Using Webscraping 
5. Tesla Stock and Revenue Dashboard
6. GameStop Stock and Revenue Dashboard


The analysis was done in Google Collaborator but the last two grpghs are not displayed here (I try to figure whether it is caused by Google or github) but if you would like to see it, you can also visit Googlecollab page that linked at the top of the page.
